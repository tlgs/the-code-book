# The Code Book

This is a _code along_ to Simon Singh's
[The Code Book](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/)
(ISBN 978-1-85702-889-8).

## Motivation

- implement simple cryptographic primitives using standard Python
- mess around with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to power a _test-first_ development cycle

## Disclaimer

This project is meant purely as an exercise to absorb the contents of the book.
**Should not be seen as a reference towards applying any cryptographic technique.**
