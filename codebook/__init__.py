## What's this?

This is a *code along* to Simon Singh's
[The Code Book](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/)
(ISBN 978-1-85702-889-8).

It implements every cipher that is described
(and given *enough* attention) in the book.
Only **encryption operations** are implemented.

The package aims to provide a consistent API across all classical ciphers.

## Disclaimer

This project is meant purely as an exercise to absorb the contents of the book.
**Should not be seen as a reference towards applying any cryptographic technique.**
